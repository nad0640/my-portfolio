But wait, there's even more to it! ‚òÄ\uFE0F\nYou can take a look at the 5-day forecast, which is like having a crystal ball for weather enthusiasts. And don't worry, I've got a feature that remembers your search history, so you don't have to type in the same details again.\nAnd here's an awesome feature: the app's interface switches between a dark and light theme depending on whether it's daytime (sunbathing time) or nighttime (stargazing time) in the city you're checking the weather for. Plus, it works like magic ‚Äì it detects your location and provides you with the weather information, so no more wondering if it's raining outside!",
